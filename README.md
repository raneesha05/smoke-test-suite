# WSO2 API Manager 4.5.0 — Operational Smoke Suite

A Postman/Newman suite that verifies a **WSO2 API Manager 4.5.0 distributed deployment**
is healthy and functional. It is designed to be run **immediately before and immediately
after any maintenance activity** — compare the two runs, so a regression is caught within
minutes rather than discovered by a customer.

The suite exercises a complete API lifecycle against a live deployment — create, publish,
deploy, subscribe, invoke, revoke, and tear down — and removes everything it creates.

| | |
|---|---|
| Checks per run | **93 assertions across 70 requests** |
| Typical runtime (In Local environment) | **13–16 seconds** |
| Runs as | A least-privilege user (no admin rights at runtime) |
| Leaves behind | Nothing — all artifacts are deleted by the suite |

---

## 1. What the suite covers

| Folder | Requests | What it verifies |
|---|---:|---|
| **1_Auth** | 6 | OAuth2 password-grant tokens are issued, and each requested scope is actually granted |
| **2_PreClean** | 10 | Removes artifacts left behind by a previous interrupted run, so a failed run cannot block the next one |
| **3_Publisher** | 10 | Create an API, read it back, update it, create and deploy a revision to the gateway, publish it; list APIs, operation policies and throttling tiers |
| **4_Documents** | 5 | Full API document lifecycle: create, read, update, delete, confirm removal |
| **5_DevPortal** | 10 | Application creation, API discovery, subscription, key generation, and the listing endpoints |
| **6_Gateway** | 4 | Obtain an access token, invoke the API through the gateway, revoke the token, confirm the gateway then rejects it |
| **7_Policy** | 12 | Throttling policy create → **attach to API** → verify → detach → delete; operation policy create → verify → delete |
| **8_Teardown** | 10 | Removes the subscription, application, revision and API, then confirms each is gone |
| **9_ExistingAPI** | 3 | A pre-existing application obtains a token, an already-deployed API is invoked through the gateway, and the token is revoked. Read-only: creates nothing |

### Full collection tree

Folders and requests are numbered so a failure can be located quickly. Newman
reports failures as `inside "7_Policy / 7.1_Throttling / 7.1.1 Create Throttling Policy"`,
which maps directly onto the inline log.

### What it deliberately does **not** cover

- **Throttling enforcement (HTTP 429).** The suite verifies a policy can be *attached* to an
  API and that the association persists. It does **not** prove the limit is enforced —
  enforcement requires a revision redeploy and sustained traffic, which would take minutes.
  Do not read "Policy attached to API" as "rate limiting works".
- **High availability / failover.** The suite checks one gateway environment; it does not
  test failover between gateway nodes.
- **Performance.** This is a functional smoke suite, not a load test.
- **Gateway sync, in `9_ExistingAPI`.** 9.2 proves an *already-deployed* API is served by the
  gateway. A gateway loads deployed APIs at startup, so 9.2 can pass even when the Control
  Plane can no longer push changes to it. That is covered by `6.2` and `6.4`, not by 9.x.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

### On the machine running the suite

| Tool | Version used | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Newman** | 6.2.2 | Runs the collection. `npm install -g newman` |
| **Node.js** | v26.5.0 | Required by Newman |
| **jq** | 1.7.1 | Used by `bootstrap-client.sh`. `brew install jq` |
| **curl** | any | Used by the setup script |

### On the target deployment

- WSO2 API Manager **4.5.0** distributed: Control Plane, Universal Gateway, Traffic Manager
- All three nodes running and reachable
- A gateway environment registered (stock name `Default` — set `gw_env_name` to yours)
- A user account for the suite to run as, with the role described in section 6
- Network access from the gateway to the backend used by the test API. `backend_url` must
  point at something the **gateway node** can reach; if the deployment is air-gapped,
  set it to an internal service that answers `GET /get`

### Stock ports

These are the out-of-the-box values. **Confirm them against your own deployment** — a port
offset, a reverse proxy or a load balancer changes them, and section 6 asks you to set the
two the suite uses.

| Node | Stock port | Used by the suite |
|---|---|---|
| Control Plane (Publisher / DevPortal / Admin APIs) | 9443 | yes — `cp_port` |
| Universal Gateway (HTTPS) | 8244 | yes — `gw_port` |
| Traffic Manager | 9445 | no — contacted by the gateway, not by the suite |

## 3. Repository structure

```
<suite-directory>/
├── README.md                                        this file
├── smoke-test-suite.postman_collection.json         the suite (70 requests)
├── APIM-4.5.0-Local.postman_environment.json        environment TEMPLATE -- copy, do not edit

---

## 4. First-time setup (run once, by an administrator)

The suite itself never creates or deletes an OAuth client — that requires privileges the
runtime user does not have, and provisioning a client on a live system minutes before a
maintenance window is undesirable.

Instead, an administrator registers the client **once** and the credentials are written
into your copy of the environment file.

```bash
cd <suite-directory>

cp APIM-4.5.0-Local.postman_environment.json working.local.json

./bootstrap-client.sh \
  --host <control-plane-host> \
  --port <control-plane-port> \
  --env working.local.json
```

You are prompted for the **admin username and password**. Deployments do not share an
admin account, so neither is baked into the command. Neither is written to disk — only
`client_id` and `client_secret` are stored.

Expected output:

```
Admin username (for client registration): wso2admin
Password for wso2admin:
-- registering 'smoke_client_wso2admin' (owner wso2admin) at https://<control-plane-host>:<port>
-- backup: working.local.json.orig
-- wrote client_id / client_secret to working.local.json
   client_id   : <your-generated-client-id>
```

Notes:

- **Safe to re-run.** WSO2's DCR endpoint is get-or-create, so repeating this returns the
  same client rather than creating a duplicate.
- Re-run it if the Key Manager is rebuilt or the client is deleted.
- `--admin-user <u>` skips the username prompt for unattended use. The password is always
  prompted and is never accepted as a flag.
- Before running the suite, open your `working.local.json` and fill in the rest of the
  values — host, gateway, and the account the suite runs as (section 6).

---

## 5. Running the suite

```bash
cd <suite-directory>

newman run smoke-test-suite.postman_collection.json \
  -e working.local.json \
  --insecure \
  --working-dir .
```

| Flag | Why it is required |
|---|---|
| `-e` | Your filled-in environment copy (section 6). Without it every `{{variable}}` resolves empty and the run collapses |
| `--insecure` | Accepts the self-signed certificates WSO2 ships with. Omit only if the deployment has trusted certificates |
| `--working-dir .` | Resolves `policy-files/` for the multipart upload. Without it two policy requests fail |

### A healthy run ends with

```
│              assertions │               93 │                0 │
├─────────────────────────┴──────────────────┴──────────────────┤
│ total run duration: 13.9s                                     │
```

**Read both numbers.** `0 failed` alone is not sufficient — see section 8.

## 6. Environment variables

Set these in your environment file before the first run.

> **Copy it first.** The committed file is a template. Copy it to a name ending in
> `.local.json` — for example `working.local.json` — and edit *that*. `*.local.json` is
> gitignored, so your filled-in copy with its password and client secret can never be
> committed. Run against the copy, not the template.

### Must be reviewed for your deployment

**Every value below must be checked against your own deployment.** `<...>` marks a
placeholder — replace the whole thing, angle brackets included. The values in brackets
after each one are what a stock single-node 4.5.0 uses, and are a reasonable starting
point, but none of them are safe to assume.

| Variable | Set it to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `cp_host` | `<control-plane-host>` | Hostname or IP of the Control Plane *(stock: `localhost`)* |
| `cp_port` | `<control-plane-port>` | Control Plane HTTPS port *(stock: `9443`)*. Different if the deployment runs with a port offset, or behind a load balancer or reverse proxy |
| `gw_host` | `<gateway-host>` | Hostname or IP of the Universal Gateway *(stock: `localhost`)*. Often, but not always, the same as `cp_host` |
| `gw_port` | `<gateway-port>` | Gateway HTTPS port *(stock: `8244`)*. Same caveat as `cp_port` |
| `vhost` | `<gateway-vhost>` | Virtual host the revision is deployed on *(stock: `localhost`)*. Usually the same value as `gw_host`. Must match a vhost registered on the gateway environment |
| `gw_env_name` | `<gateway-environment>` | Gateway environment name **exactly as registered** in Admin Portal → Gateways *(stock: `Default`)* |
| `admin_user` | `<runtime-username>` | The account the suite runs as |
| `admin_pass` | `<runtime-password>` | That account's password |
| `backend_url` | `<backend-url>` | Backend the test API proxies *(example: `https://httpbin.org`)*. Must be reachable **from the gateway node** — if that host has no outbound internet access, point this at any internal HTTP service that answers `GET /get` |

> **The ports matter as much as the hosts.** A deployment behind a reverse proxy, or one
> started with a port offset, exposes neither `9443` nor `8244`. Confirm both before the
> first run — a wrong port fails every request with a connection error, not a clear
> message.

> **`admin_user` is not an administrator.** The name is historical. It is the
> **least-privilege** account the suite runs as, and it needs exactly the scopes listed
> below — nothing more. It is *not* the admin account `bootstrap-client.sh` prompts for;
> that one is only used to register the OAuth client and is never stored anywhere.

### Test artifact names — change only if they clash

The suite creates, verifies and deletes these on every run. Change them only if something
with the same name already exists on the deployment.

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `api_name` | `SMOKE_FixedTest1` | **Keep the `SMOKE` prefix.** It is what scopes every delete in the suite (section 8) |
| `api_context` | `smoke-fixed-1` | Context path. Must be unique across the deployment |
| `api_version` | `1.0.0` | |

### Existing API check — `9_ExistingAPI`

The folder invokes an API that already exists on the deployment, using an application that
is already subscribed to it. The suite only reads them; it never creates, changes or deletes
either one. Leave the two credentials blank to skip the folder (the run then reports 90
assertions and lists 9.1–9.3 as SKIPPED).

| Variable | Set it to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `existing_api_path` | `<context>/<version>` | Path after the gateway host, no leading slash *(default: `wso2_main_gateway_health_check_api/v1`)* |
| `existing_app_client_id` | `<consumer-key>` | Consumer key of an application subscribed to that API. Its grant types must include **Client Credentials** |
| `existing_app_client_secret` | `<consumer-secret>` | That application's consumer secret |

> **Use an application dedicated to this check.** 9.1 issues a token for the application and
> 9.3 revokes it. Unless `renew_token_without_revoking_existing` is enabled, issuing a new
> token can revoke the application's previously active token — so do not point this at an
> application that real consumers use.

### Written automatically — leave blank, do not edit by hand

| Variable | Set by |
|---|---|
| `client_id` / `client_secret` | `bootstrap-client.sh` (section 4) |
| `expected_client_id` | The suite, on its first run. It pins the client id and compares it every run after — see section 8 |

### Required role and scopes

The runtime account needs a role granting these scopes:

```
apim:api_create      apim:api_delete     apim:api_publish    apim:api_view
apim:subscribe       apim:app_manage     apim:sub_manage
apim:document_create apim:document_manage
apim:tier_manage     apim:tier_view
apim:common_operation_policy_view        apim:common_operation_policy_manage
apim:api_mediation_policy_manage
```

## 7. Reading the results

Newman's summary has four rows. Only one of them indicates a broken deployment.

| Row | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `requests` | HTTP calls sent. Higher than the request count when retries occur; lower when requests are skipped |
| `prerequest-scripts` | Setup scripts run. Exceeds the request count because one collection-level script runs before **every** request |
| `test-scripts` | Post-response scripts run |
| **`assertions`** | **The individual checks. This is the number that matters** |

### Important: skipped requests are not failures

When a request fails, the requests that depend on its output are **skipped** — one root
cause produces one failure rather than a cascade of eight. Those skips are **not** counted
as failures.

This means a run can report `0 failed` while having checked far less than it should.
**Always read the assertion total alongside the failure count.**

- A full healthy run is **93 assertions** (90 if the `9_ExistingAPI` credentials are left blank).
- `0 failed` with fewer assertions than that means something was skipped.

To make this visible, every run prints a summary before the results table:

```
===== RUN SUMMARY =====
SKIPPED (3) -- these did NOT run, so the check
count below is LOWER than a full run. Fix the failure above first:
   - Get Throttling Policy
   - Delete Throttling Policy
   - Verify Throttling Policy Deleted
========================
```

Requests that gate a folder also carry a note in their failure message explaining that
their dependents were skipped.

---

## 8. Important notes

**The suite recovers from its own failures.**
`2_PreClean` removes any `SMOKE`-prefixed artifact left over from an interrupted run —
API, application and throttling policy — before creating anything. A run that is killed
half-way does not block the next one. Recovery runs report *more* assertions than normal
(around 98), because PreClean has real work to verify.

**Every delete is scoped to the `SMOKE` prefix.**
The cleanup logic only ever matches artifacts whose name begins with `SMOKE`. It is
structurally incapable of deleting a customer API, application or throttling tier. Preserve
this property in any modification.

**Artifact names are fixed, not randomised.**
The same names are reused every run. This is safe because of PreClean, and it keeps the
API context stable and predictable.

**Two asynchronous operations are polled, never slept through.**
Gateway artifact sync after a deployment takes roughly 5–6 seconds, and token revocation
propagates to the gateway via the Traffic Manager. Both are handled with bounded retries
that fail with a diagnostic naming the likely component.

**Attach is not enforcement.** See section 1.

**Deleting an API leaves a registry entry behind.**
This is WSO2 behaviour, not a fault in the suite: each API deletion leaves rows under
`/_system/governance/apimgt/applicationdata/provider/` that are never reclaimed. It is
harmless — names remain reusable, because `2_PreClean` clears leftovers before each run —
but the row count grows over time. If you ever need to check it:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM REG_PATH
WHERE REG_PATH_VALUE LIKE '%/applicationdata/provider/%';
```

**The environment file contains credentials.**
`admin_pass` and `client_secret` are stored in plain text. Treat your filled-in copy as a
secrets file: `chmod 600` it, and keep the `.local.json` name so the gitignore rule covers
it. `bootstrap-client.sh` also leaves a `.orig` backup holding the same values — that is
covered by the `*.orig` rule.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| `client_id/client_secret are missing from the environment` and the run stops after one request | `bootstrap-client.sh` has not been run against this environment file. See section 4 |
| Every request fails against `localhost` when your deployment is elsewhere | `cp_host` / `gw_host` were left at the template defaults. See section 6 |
| Two policy requests fail with a file-not-found error | `--working-dir .` was omitted, or `policy-files/` is missing |
| Every request fails with a TLS error | `--insecure` was omitted |
| `7.1.1 Create Throttling Policy` returns **401** | The runtime role lacks `apim:tier_manage`. See section 6 |
| `6.2 Invoke API` fails after 20 attempts with **404** | The revision did not reach the gateway. Check Control Plane → Gateway artifact sync and that the revision deployed to the `Default` label |
| `6.4 Invoke with Revoked Token` never returns 401 | Token revocation events are not reaching the gateway. Check the Traffic Manager JMS topic and the gateway's event listener configuration |
| `9.1 Generate Access Token (Existing APP)` returns **401** | `existing_app_client_id` / `existing_app_client_secret` are wrong, or the application's grant types do not include Client Credentials |
| `9.2 Invoke Existing API` returns **404** | The existing API is not deployed on this gateway, or `existing_api_path` / the vhost is wrong |
| `9.2 Invoke Existing API` returns **403** | The application is not subscribed to the API, or the subscription has not reached the gateway |
| `OAuth client unchanged since the pinned run` fails | The OAuth client was recreated — typically a Key Manager rebuild or a database restore. Re-run `bootstrap-client.sh` and clear `expected_client_id` |
| A run reports `0 failed` but fewer than 93 checks | Requests were skipped. Read the `RUN SUMMARY` block above the results table |
